  title: About Me
  description: |2-
     Since 2018, I am the receiver group leader at the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimetrique (IRAM), France. I have been working for the past 20 years developing and using radioastronomical instrumentation on several telescopes - HIFI/Herschel, APEX, IRAM 30m, IRAM NOEMA, Onsala and SOFIA.

    I received the M.Sc. degree from l'École Supérieure d'Électricité (Supélec), Gif-sur-Yvette, France, in 1998, and the Ph.D. degree from Chalmers University of Technology, Göteborg, Sweden, in 2005. Since 1998, I worked at various radio astronomy observatories developing novel instrumentation and supporting observations. Among those are the IRAM 30 m telescope in Granada, Spain, the Chalmers University of Technology with the Onsala Observatory, Sweden, the Apex Telescope with the European Southern Observatory, the HIFI instrument with the Herschel Observatory. From 2011 until 2018, I worked at the Max Planck Institut für Radioastronomie in Bonn, Germany as a project manager responsible for the development of the upGREAT array receivers for the SOFIA NASA/DLR airborne observatory
